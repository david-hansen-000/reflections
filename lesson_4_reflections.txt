When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--- Remote repositories allow others to see/contribute/collaborate on a project. But, personally, I can also see myself using a remote repository to access and make changes from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--- For the same reasons we do manual commits instead of letting the system save automatically. It's a matter of keeping track of the changes and being aware of conflicts. Otherwise it could be a huge hassle to fix things that might not have needed so much fixing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

--- Forking is specific to GitHub. It is basically cloning, but it shows where the repository was cloned from, allowing credit for where the repository was forked from. Cloning is making a local repository and automatically sets the origin. It allows pushing changes back to the remote repository if the user has permissions to change the remote repository. Branching is more like a special clone that is local and allows working on attributes that may or may not need to be included in the final production of the project.
